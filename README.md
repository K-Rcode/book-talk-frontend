## Description

Have you ever been deep into a good book, and just wanted to converse with someone else whoâ€™s equally as enthralled. Or just leave your thoughts in the air. Introduce Book Talk, an application built to host book discussions. Users can login, add a book that they would like to talk about, and leave comments for other readers to respond to.

## User Stories

### MVP
- As a user, I would like to upload a book so I can start a conversation about it.
- As a user, I would like to comment on books so I can be included in the dialog. 
- As a user, I would like to see all comments about a particular book, so I can add relevant information in the dialog. 
- As a user, I would like to log in, so no one can comment on my behalf
- As a user, I would like to be able to edit and delete my comments, so I can correct mistakes. 

### STRETCH
- As a user, I would like to see a list of books another user read, to gauge if we have similar interests.
- As a user, I would like to know which books are most recently talked about, so I can join in on a hot conversation.
- As a user, I would like a publicly generated list of books(API) that I can choose from, so that I can find new books to check out.

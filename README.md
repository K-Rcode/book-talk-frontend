## Description

Have you ever been deep into a good book, and just wanted to converse with someone else who’s equally as enthralled. Or just leave your thoughts in the air. Introduce Book Talk, an application built to host book discussions. Users can login, add a book that they would like to talk about, and leave comments for other readers to respond to.

## User Stories

### MVP
- As a user, I would like to upload a book so I can start a conversation about it.
- As a user, I would like to comment on books so I can be included in the dialog. 
- As a user, I would like to see all comments about a particular book, so I can add relevant information in the dialog. 
- As a user, I would like to log in, so no one can comment on my behalf
- As a user, I would like to be able to edit and delete my comments, so I can correct mistakes. 

### STRETCH
- As a user, I would like to see a list of books another user read, to gauge if we have similar interests.
- As a user, I would like to know which books are most recently talked about, so I can join in on a hot conversation.
- As a user, I would like a publicly generated list of books(API) that I can choose from, so that I can find new books to check out.
